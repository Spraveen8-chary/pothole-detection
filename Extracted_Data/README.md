# Extracted Data Directory

The `Extracted_Data` directory is intended to store the images and labels used for training the model.

## Note
This directory is currently empty because the model is designed to load images and labels after training. The dataset is quite large, which is why I have not included the actual images and labels in this repository. Users are encouraged to download the dataset and place the images and labels in this directory for the model to function properly.

## Usage
Once the dataset is prepared, ensure that the images and corresponding labels are correctly placed in this directory. The model will automatically access the data during training and prediction processes.
